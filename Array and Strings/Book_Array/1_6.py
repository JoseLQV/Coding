# String Compression: pg -> 91 , pg ->201
# Implement a method to perform basic string compression using the counts of repeated characters. For Example, 
# the string aabccccaaa would become a2b1c5a3.
# if the "compressed" string would not become smaller than the original string,
# your method should return the original string. You can assume the string has only 
# uppercase and lowercase letters(a-z).
